      <h4>Question: I’m in an accident. What should I do?</h4>
      <p>
        <b>STEP 1</b>: Stop your vehicle. If your vehicle is involved in an
        accident and you don’t stop, you may be subject to criminal prosecution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>STEP 2</b>: If it is safe to do so, get out of your car. If you have
        access to a digital camera or a cell phone, you should use it to take
        pictures of the scene.
      </p>
      <h4>REMEMBER</h4>
      <div style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As difficult as it may seem, it is important that you remain calm.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not argue with other drivers and passengers. Save your story for
            the police.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not voluntarily assume liability or take responsibility, sign
            statements regarding fault, or promise to pay for damage at the
            scene of the accident.
          </li>
          <li>Be watchful for unauthorized tow truck operators.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h4>Question: Do I need to call the police?</h4>
      <p>
        Call the police if collisions meet at least one of the following
        criteria:
      </p>
      <div style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH</b>
          </li>
          <p>
            --Someone has been injured and taken to hospital (usually via
            ambulance), or someone has died. Minor injuries (cuts, scrapes,
            bruises, etc), or tissue damage (whiplash, etc), are not serious
            injuries in the purview of police response. We encourage people to
            get medical treatment at a later time.
          </p>
          <li>
            <b>CRIME</b>
          </li>
          <p>
            --A Criminal offence has been committed. Impaired Driving, Dangerous
            Driving, Criminal Negligence, Police Pursuit, etc, are all Criminal
            offences. Speeding, failing to stop for a red light, and following
            too close are not Criminal offences
          </p>
          <li>
            <b>PUBLIC SAFETY</b>
          </li>
          <p>
            --If your vehicle is not moveable, is blocking a major roadway, and
            the police are needed to direct traffic so that a second collision
            does not occur, police should be called. A collision in a parking
            lot or on a residential street does not meet this criteria. A
            collision on a busy road, at the crest of a hill, or around a blind
            curve are collisions that the police should attend to make sure that
            a second collision does not occur.
          </p>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h4>Question: Are you blocking traffic?</h4>
      <p>
        When it is safe, move your vehicle to the side of the road out of
        traffic. If your vehicle cannot be driven, turn on your hazard lights or
        use cones, warning triangles or flares, as appropriate.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Question: What information do I need to get from the other driver?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Record the following information; you may also use your cell phone to
        audio record as much information as possible.

        Call your insurance company as soon as possible after the accident.
        Inform them what happened and ask for next steps.
      </p>
      <h4>Question: How can I be prepared for any emergency on the road?</h4>
      <p>
        Always keep a basic vehicle first aid or emergency kit in the trunk of
        your vehicle. You can easily create an emergency kit for your vehicle by
        filling a plastic storage container with the following items:{" "}
